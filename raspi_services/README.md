How to setup the Drone UDP Server Service
=================================

This document provides instructions on how to set up the Drone UDP Server as a systemd service on a Linux system.
Installation Steps
-----------------

1. **Create the Service File**: Create a new service file in the systemd directory.

   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/drone.service
   ```

2. **Add Service Configuration**: Copy and paste the following configuration into the service file:

   ```service
    [Unit]
    Description=Drone UDP Server
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/home/drone/drone
    WorkingDirectory=/home/drone
    Restart=always
    User=root

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

3. **Reload systemd**: After creating or modifying the service file, reload the systemd manager configuration to recognize the new service.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable drone.service
    sudo systemctl start drone.service
    ```

4. **Check Service Status**: You can check the status of the service to ensure it is running correctly.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status drone.service
    ```

5. **View Logs**: To view the logs generated by the service, you can use the `journalctl` command.
    ```bash
    sudo journalctl -fu drone.service
    ```
